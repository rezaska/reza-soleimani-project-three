2. shuffling cards.
3. allow the user to ask a hint.

// check whether the document is ready for JS.
// have an event listener for click on one of the cards.
// create a loop through the chosen card.

// if the selected card is not joker then let the user choose second card (show "choose the next card" message).
// if the second selected card is joker then the game is over (show "game over" message).
